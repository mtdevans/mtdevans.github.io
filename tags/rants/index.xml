      <description>So&amp;hellip;, &amp;ldquo;so&amp;rdquo; used as here needs to die.
It adds nothing by its use but an air of aloof faux-intellectualism. It is not continuing a flow of thought. It is not communicating emphasis. It is superfluous and annoying.
It is a faux so.
It attempts to cast the hearer as a dumb dog eagerly awaiting the ball to leave the trainer&amp;rsquo;s hand at the time only of his knowing and choosing.</description>

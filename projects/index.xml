      <description>Physics Notes, Solutions, and Related Stuff
I’ve written up a couple of foundational and a few somewhat challenging physics problems and notes which I think the web could benefit from. I’ve started with a few from Statistical Physics, and will be adding more in time that&amp;rsquo;s all, folks!.
Note: I recently migrated these pages from my old site, so be sure to look out for typos.</description>

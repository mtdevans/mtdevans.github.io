<h2 id="particle-physics">Particle Physics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Essay: <a href="/stuff/OnTheDiscoveryOfSymmetryViolations.pdf">On the Discovery of Symmetry Violations and Their Effect on the Trajectory of Elementary Particle Physics Research</a>. Forgive the punny title, this is an essay I wrote on symmetry violations in particle physics. Especially if you’re relatively new to particle physics, I’d say this is a good primer of its historical background and major developments, from the foundation of quantum mechanics right up to the Higgs and beyond.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/fixed-target-vs-collider-experiments-with-discussion">Fixed Target vs Collider Experiments</a>. Calculation and brief discussion of the difference in energy requirement between a proton-hydrogen fixed target and a beam-colliding pp accelerator like the LHC.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/mandelstam-variables-with-identical-particles">Mandelstam Variables with Identical Particles</a>, and how the general equations reduce to this case, \(A + A → A + A\).</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/interactions-of-charged-particles-with-matter">Interactions of Charged Particles with Matter</a>. The energy loss of various charged particles passing through a block of iron.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="statistical-physics">Statistical Physics</h2>
<p><strong>GENERAL/FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEMS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/deriving-stirlings-formula">Deriving Stirling’s Formula</a> using an analogy to the Gaussian distribution.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/particle-in-a-one-dimensional-box">Particle in a One Dimensional Box</a>. We calculate the classical phase space volume and quantum number of states, and prove adiabatic invariance when the box is enlarged.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/random-walk-of-two-drunks">Random Walk of Two Drunks</a>. As light-hearted as maths gets, but a good introduction to random walks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MICROCANONICAL ENSEMBLE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/system-of-n-harmonic-oscillators">System of N Harmonic Oscillators</a>. An important example in statistical physics including the number of accessible states, entropy, and energy of the system.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/mixture-of-two-ideal-gases">Mixture of Two Ideal Gases</a>. Another important example in statistical physics.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/polymer-bundle-2-d-microcanonical-approach">Two-Dimensional Polymer Bundle</a>. A look at a basic model of a two-dimensional polymer from the viewpoint of the microcanonical ensemble. An interesting example not often used in textbooks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CANONICAL ENSEMBLE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/diatomic-molecule-as-rigid-rotor">Modelling a Diatomic Molecule (CO) as a Rigid Rotor</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GRANDCANONICAL ENSEMBLE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/exchange-of-particles-between-subsystems">Exchange of Particles between Subsystems</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/adsorption-of-molecules-onto-a-surface">Adsorption of Molecules onto a Surface</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/maxwell-relations">The Maxwell Relations</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THERMODYNAMICS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/diesel-cycle-efficiency">Diesel Cycle Efficiency</a>. Deriving a useful result for the efficiency of the Diesel cycle in terms of the compression ratios.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/physics-problems/reverse-carnot-cycle-efficiency">Reverse Carnot Cycle Efficiency</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is obviously not meant to be exhaustive of questions or notes relevant to a topic (if you’re looking for lecture notes, you could do worse than the website (archived as it got yoinked) of a friend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180321081958/http://jpoffline.com/">JPOffline</a>, but to help you understand the topics I’m passionate about. They’re not primarily intended for you to blindly copy&mdash;but of course, you are welcome to do so.</p>
